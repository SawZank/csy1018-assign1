          About me..<br>
        </div>
        <div class="pbody"><br><br><br>I'm a computing student currently studying  at Nami College, Nepal. I aim to be a successful software engineer in the future. <br>
        I am very enthusiastic about technology and programming. I try to combine both of these things together when I'm studying or when I'm working on something. <br>
        <br>I'm also a gamer and I regularly play games. Playing games is my way of relieving stress. I've been gaming since I was a kid, so it is something that I absolutely love to do.<br> I wish to be a successful game developer in the future.
        I mostly play games on my latptop. Most of the time, I play online games with my friends or even with strangers. Gaming has helped me a lot to make new friends. <br>
      Besides playing games, I love to read. I love reading novels and journals when I'm not gaming. I also like to hang out with my friends when I'm bored.<br>
    <br>At present, I'm not working anywhere and I don't think I will be working any time soon. I feel like not working because I believe that a job may interfere with my studies. So, I plan to work
  after I've completed my studies.<br>I like being lonely. Spending time alone gives me the opportunity to think about a lot of things. When I'm alone, I like listening to music. My taste in music<br>
varies very much. I listen to almost all kinds of genres ranging from classicals, rock, metal to even pop. If a song is good, then I don't care about its genre. So, when it comes to music, I'm very open minded.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div>
